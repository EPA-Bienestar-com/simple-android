# (WIP) Migrating to Mobius

This document outlines the process and methodology we use to migrate from our [v1 screen architecture](arch/001-screen-controllers.md) to our [v3 architcture](arch/008-screen-architecture-v3.md), which is based on [Mobius](https://github.com/spotify/mobius), a reactive state management framework by Spotify.

The overall method we use to migrate to Mobius is similar to the **`StranglerFigApplication`** pattern detailed by Martin Fowler [here](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html).

### TODO: Document the process here.

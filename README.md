# Simple

An Android app for recording blood pressure measurements.

## How to build

1. Clone the project using git
2. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
3. Import the project into Android Studio

When building for the first time, gradle will download all dependencies so it'll take a few minutes to complete. Subsequent builds will be faster.

## Build and deploy Simple Server

Simple Server is in a separate repository, and you should follow the [instructions there](https://github.com/simpledotorg/simple-server/blob/master/README.md).

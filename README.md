[![Build Status](https://www.bitrise.io/app/db9b195f645cfed7/status.svg?token=0UVLxgCzsz75d21FUnkfhg&branch=master)](https://www.bitrise.io/app/db9b195f645cfed7)

RedApp, a mobile app for recording blood pressure measurements.

RedApp uses a [library](https://github.com/gabrielittner/lazythreetenbp) to adapt ThreeTenBP (backport of Java 8's date and time packages). Due to some limitations, the IDE does not know how to download its sources. To work around, the sources can be downloaded from [the maven repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cthreetenbp) and manually be attached to Android Studio.

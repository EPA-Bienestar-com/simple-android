 * There are three timestamps that are always present in every single synced model:
 *
 * - `createdAt`: When the database record was created.
 * - `updatedAt`: When the database record was updated.
 * - `deletedAt`: When the database record was deleted.
 *
 * All timestamps are in UTC.
 *
 * This class is meant to encapsulate these timestamps as an [Embedded] model in the database
 * entities.
